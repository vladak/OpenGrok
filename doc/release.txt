Release criteria
----------------

Ideally, the following minimum criteria should be fulfilled before a new
version is released:

  - The code coverage for blocks must be at least 80%
  - No findbugs warnings
  - No stoppers
  - All bugs and enhancements must be evaluated


Checklist for releasing OpenGrok:
---------------------------------

0) set new version

   mvn versions:set -DgenerateBackupPoms=false -DnewVersion=1.1-rcXYZ

   Then commit and push the change:

     git commit --all
     git push

1) build must be clean

   mvn clean package

2) sanity check:

   - index
   - deploy webapp
   - check UI:
     - history view
       - try comparing 2 distant revisions
       - check pagination
     - annotate view
     - directory listing
       - check sorting using multiple criteria
     - perform search using multiple fields across multiple projects

3) check all tests, tests code coverage:
   junit, pmd, findbugs, checkstyle, emma, jdepend

   emma reports should be based according to what is set for the release,
   usually it's overall coverage above 80%.

   Jenkins can help here.

   The release is OK, once above is fulfilled to our satisfaction.

4) Trigger release creation

     git tag 1.1-rcXYZ
     git push origin tag 1.1-rcXYZ

   Wait for the build to finish and release created.

   Go to https://github.com/OpenGrok/OpenGrok/releases and edit the text
   of the release, e.g. adding list of issues fixed, whether complete reindex
   is necessary etc.

5) Send announcement to opengrok-users@yahoogroups.com, Slack channel etc.
